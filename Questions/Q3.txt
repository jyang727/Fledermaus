You are given a positive integer A. The goal is to construct the shortest 
 possible sequence of integers ending with A, using the following rules:

 the first element of the sequence is 1,
 each of the successive elements is the sum of any two preceding elements (
 adding a single element to itself is also permissible),
 each element is larger than all the preceding elements; that is, the 
 sequence is increasing.

 For example, for A = 42, a possible solutions is [1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, 42 ].
 Another possible solution is [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 16, 21, 42].
